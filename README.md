#**Analyzing Personal Expenses**

This project aims to simulate an expense tracker for an individual using the Faker library. The project generates realistic monthly expense data, processes and stores it in a SQL database, and creates SQL queries to derive insights into spending behavior. A Streamlit app is developed to visualize these insights and showcase the results of SQL queries. The tracker will highlight expenses across categories like bills, groceries, subscriptions, and personal spending, providing a comprehensive overview of financial habits over a year.

**Business Use Cases:**
Automating the tracking of personal or business expenses from e-commerce platforms.
Analyzing and categorizing spending habits to create actionable savings plans.
Building financial dashboards for tracking income and expenditure trends.Providing businesses insights into procurement and inventory purchasing patterns.

**Approach:**
Data Simulation: Use the **Faker library** to generate a realistic dataset that depicts a personâ€™s expense throughout the month.create 12 different tables for each month.

Database Creation: Create a SQL database schema and load the generated dataset for querying.

EDA: Analyze the dataset using Python libraries to extract insights about spending patterns and trends.

Streamlit App: Develop a user-friendly web application showcasing visualizations and SQL query outputs.

Insights & Recommendations: Provide actionable takeaways based on simulated data analysis.
